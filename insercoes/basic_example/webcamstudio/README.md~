#Using Webcamstudio
https://sourceforge.net/projects/webcamstudio/

I saw it is possible to replicate what my script does using this java-based software. However, I didn't manage to make it work properly yet: it was slow on Kamilla's computer (around 15 FPS maximum to get a video from youtube running locally, and sound was struggling as well). The interface was not intuitive to me.

Just checked the CPU usage: Java was tooking around 200%!
